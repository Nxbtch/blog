## Blog With Rails

example: [hechen0.com](https://hechen0.com)

### Why not use a static website generator like jekyll, hugo...?

For me, only one reason: control.

control means a lot, not only the code, but also your blog data, everything you write, you care, you have the right to chose what you will accept and what you can refuse.

### Should you build your blog or any website by hand?

nope. The only exception is when you love to do build something.

### What can you learn by building your website by hand?

learn something you dont know, when you familiar with it, try to automate it.

### What can you get from this project?

nothing fancy, just basic rails stuff

### no introduction?

Yeah. lazy
